    <h1>Telescope Auth Service Test</h1>
    <p>
      This is a small client web app used to help test the auth service setup. It assumes you are
      running the microservices. If you haven't done so already, you should do the following in the
      root of the Telescope project:
    </p>

    <code>
      <pre>
        pnpm run services:start
      </pre>
    </code>

    <p>That will start the necessary services for this demo to work.</p>

    <nav>
      <ul>
        <!-- The href for these will be generated at startup via JS -->
        <li>
          <button id="login">Login</button> Start the login flow (Username=user1,
          Password=user1pass). Send state and get back state and a token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <button id="logout">Logout</button> Start the logout flow. Send state and expect to get
          the same state back.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>

    <div>
      <h2>Query String Params</h2>
      <p>The following values were found on the query string, returned from the auth server:</p>
      <ol>
        <li id="access-token">Not Found</li>
        <li id="state">Not Found</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Expected State</h2>
      <p>When we login or logout, and get redirected back again, this is the state we expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li id="expected-state"></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Token Data</h2>
      <p>The following information was included with the access token:</p>
      <ul id="jwt"></ul>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>
