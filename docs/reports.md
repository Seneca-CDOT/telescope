# Reports

There are a number of reports that get generated, and can aid in developer understanding.

## Coverage

The report you can generate is test coverage information. To generate this report,
run the following command:

```
npm run coverage
```

After the tests complete, a text summary report is printed. However, a much more
useful, dynamic HTML version is created in `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`, which
you can open in your web browser.
