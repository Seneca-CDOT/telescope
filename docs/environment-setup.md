## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites:

- [Node.js (npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (2 methods)
  - Use [Docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
  - Install as a [native application](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch) (3 methods)
  - Use `MOCK_ELASTIC=1` in your `.env` to use a mock in-memory Elastic (useful for local dev)
  - Use [Docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
  - Install as a [native application](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/7.6/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch)

**Important: Both Redis and Elasticsearch must be running in order for Telescope to work. Otherwise, it will crash.**

### Install Redis as a native application

#### Linux:

Install Redis using your distribution's package manager, for example:

- Ubuntu based: `sudo apt install redis`
- Red Hat, Fedora: `sudo dnf install redis`

_Once Redis is installed, you can start it in a terminal by running:_

```
redis-server
```

#### Windows:

There are two methods to install Redis on Windows. We strongly recommend the first approach.

##### Option 1: Using [WSL2 (Windows Subsystem Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)

1. Follow Microsoft WSL2 [installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to complete the installation
2. Follow Redis [installation guide](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart#installing-redis) to install Redis
3. Suggest to install [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-windows-terminal-optional), it facilitates you to switch directories between WSL2 Ubuntu bash and Windows drive

##### Option 2: Using [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/) to install Redis on Windows

To get Chocolatey, simply follow this [guide](https://chocolatey.org/install) and run the following commands:

1. To install Redis: `choco install redis-64 -v`
1. To set Redis as a windows service: `redis-server --service-install`
1. To start Redis: `redis-server --service-start`
1. To check if running and display server information: `redis-cli info`

### Install Elasticsearch as a native application

To install Elasticsearch as a native application, follow the instructions for your OS [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/7.6/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch)

### Docker and Docker-Compose Set Up

#### Linux-Ubuntu

This guide is sourced from the official [Docker-CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) Installation Documentation.

**Install Docker Engine - Community Edition**

1. Update the apt package index: `sudo apt-get update`
2. Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```

3. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key: `curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -`
4. Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint: `sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88`
5. Use the following command to set up the stable repository:

```
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

6. Update the apt package index again: `sudo apt-get update`
7. Install the latest version of Docker Engine community: `sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io`
8. Add yourself to the Docker group ([source](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)):
   1. Create the Docker group: `groupadd docker`
   1. Add your user to the group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
   1. Log out and log back in (you may have to restart if you are running through a virtual machine)
9. Verify your installation by running `docker run hello-world`. This should print a hello world paragraph that includes a confirmation that Docker is working on your system.
   _NOTE: This may cause errors if you have already tried to run docker before. If you get errors then run the following commands to reset it:_

```
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /home/"$USER"/.docker -R
sudo chmod g+rwx "$HOME/.docker" -R
```

10. Now run docker as a service on your machine, on startup:
    1. Enable docker on startup: `sudo systemctl enable docker`
    1. Disable docker on startup: `sudo systemctl disable docker`

**Install Docker-Compose**

11. Run to download the current stable version of Docker-Compose:

```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

12. Apply executable permissions to the downloaded file: `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
13. Check installation using: `docker-compose --version`

_NOTE: This will not work on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Use the approach listed above under WSL._

#### MacOS (Sierra 10.12 or above)

1. Get [Docker for Desktop For Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
1. Docker for Desktop comes with docker-compose installed.

#### Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Hyper-V)

1. Get [Docker for Desktop For Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
1. Docker for Desktop comes with docker-compose installed.

#### Windows 10 Home, Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Insiders / WSL 2 / Docker)

1. If your [Windows build number](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-check-your-windows-10-build) is below [18917](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install/), join the [insiders program](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/). Then, update your machine to a newer build through Automatic Updates.
2. Once installed successfully, install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install).
3. Open a Windows PowerShell window for the next few commands.
4. Leverage the command `wsl --set-default-version 2`, and install Ubuntu from the Windows Store.
5. Use `wsl -l -v` to see your Ubuntu instance version, if it's still using WSL version 1, convert it to WSL 2 using `wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2`.
6. Install any other prerequisites listed on [Docker Desktop WSL Preview](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/).
7. Download and install [Docker Desktop Edge Latest](https://download.docker.com/win/edge/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
8. Follow the instructions on the [Docker Desktop WSL Preview](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/) to configure the WSL based engine. Docker-compose is installed with the Docker desktop application.
9. Follow the Docker commands `docker-compose up --build` listed below in greater detail to start hacking.

## After installing the prerequisites:

In the root directory, run `cp env.example .env` on Linux/Mac or `copy env.example .env`.

_Note: The `env.example` file has examples commented on top of each variable_

### Now you can start Redis and Elasticsearch without errors using one of the following methods:

_Note: Make sure only one of the below options are used when starting Telescope_

#### Option 1: Using Docker

```
sudo systemctl start docker
docker-compose up --build redis elasticsearch
```

_Note: You may need to add your user to the docker group in Linux to use `docker-compose` without `sudo`. To do this, try `groups $USER` in a terminal and check if docker is in the list of groups. If not, add it with `usermod -aG docker $USER` and reboot._

**Important:** Docker builds Telescope's dependencies at launch and keeps them on disk. In some cases, Docker might try to reuse already-built dependencies or cached data, causing misleading results when testing Telescope. To avoid this, it is recommended to use the command `docker system prune -af --volumes` to remove all already-built Telescope dependencies and ensure fresh deployments.
More information about docker: [images vs containers](https://www.baeldung.com/docker-images-vs-containers) and [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

#### Option 2: Natively installed:

#### Redis:

Run `redis-server`

_Note: If experiencing an error such as `Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:6379: bind: address already in use` when using either option to start Redis. Check if an existing instance of redis is already running (Docker/Native) and stop it before starting another instance_

#### Elasticsearch:

To run Elasticsearch natively, follow the instructions for your OS [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/7.6/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch)

### Finally

Run `npm start` and open `localhost:3000`
