# Contributing to Telescope

## Welcome

We are all eager to work on telescope, and this document will help you to get started!

For community discussions, join our [#telescope Slack channel](https://seneca-open-source.slack.com/archives/CS5DGCAE5).

## Issues

Before creating an issue:

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/telescope/issues). Someone else may be working on the same thing!
- If they are, reach out and try to help.
- Use [our Labels](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/telescope/labels) to help others quickly understand what an issue is all about.

## Local Environment Setup

Telescope has many parts, and setup requires you to install a number of tools
and dependencies. For instructions on how to setup your Telescope environment, please see
the [Environment Setup documentation](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/telescope/blob/master/docs/environment-setup.md). For a discussion of Telescope's design, see our [Architecture](architecture.md) documentation.

## Browser-based Setup using Gitpod

If you are just getting started, we recommend setting up Telescope locally first
to familiarize yourself with the workflows of a typical project.

However, you can also start an automated development environment and access it
through your browser, please refer to [Develop on Gitpod](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/telescope/blob/master/docs/gitpod.md)

## Workflow in Git and GitHub

We use a number of tools and automated processes to help make it easier for
everyone to collaborate on Telescope. This includes things like auto-formatting
code, linting, and automated testing. We also use git and GitHub in particular
ways.

For more information on working with our tools and our workflows, see our [Git Workflow documentation](git-workflow.md).

## Reports

We have a number of automated reports and audits that can be run on the code.
These include things like checking accessibility and performance issues in our
frontend, and determining test coverage for our automated tests.

For more information on working with these automated reports, see our [Reports documentation](reports.md).

## Releases

When doing a release of Telescope, a number of steps must be done. To help our
maintainers do this properly, we have tools and information in our [Release documentation](release.md).
