## MVP Features

- [ ] Written in one of node.js or Python, or a mix of the two if that makes sense
- [ ] Able to parse and use the existing [Planet Feed List format](https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/Planet_CDOT_Feed_List), especially RSS and Atom feeds
- [ ] Static HTML generated from current feed posts, shown in chronological order
- [ ] Logging, especially of errors or other issues when downloading and parsing feeds
- [ ] Process should be automatic, running continually, restart itself if it crashes
- [ ] Ability to send emails to admins, users when things go wrong or need attention
- [ ] Everything is configurable. It should be easy for the admin(s) to turn features on and off via "feature flags." It should be easy to merge new features and flag them off until they are ready to be used.
- [ ] Test harness and an initial set of tests
- [ ] Use of CI/CD, running tests and doing automatic deploys
- [ ] Running on Seneca's [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) container cloud
