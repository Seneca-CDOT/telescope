## What is Telescope?

[Seneca College](https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html) is active in the open
source community. For more than a decade, faculty and students have been
blogging about their open source research and development using a variety of
platforms (WordPress, Medium, Blogger, and many others). In order to keep
track of all these posts across so many different platforms, we created Telescope.

Telescope is an open source web server and client application for aggregating
and presenting a timeline of Seneca's open source blogs. Telescope makes it easy
to see what's happening with open source at Seneca right now.

You can read a more detailed discussion of the project's original goals in
the [Overview](src/web/docusaurus/docs/overview.md) document, and learn about its [Architecture](src/web/docusaurus/docs/architecture.md).

## Why the name 'Telescope'?

The Telescope project is an example of ["planet"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)>):
a tool for aggregating blog feeds. Since we've used our old Planet to keep track
of what people are doing in open source at Seneca, we decided to call our software
"Telescope," because it lets us look out and see what's happening in orbit around
Seneca.

## Who built it?

Telescope was created in the fall of 2019 by 60 students in Seneca's open source courses
OSD600 and DPS909, and has been updated and maintained by 100 other students since then.

## How can I get involved?

We're still actively developing and maintaining Telescope, and if you'd like to help,
we'd be glad to have you join us.
