# Renovate and Telescope

Telescope uses [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) to check outdated dependencies and generate PRs to update dependencies. By default, Renovate checks all `package.json`, `dockerfile`, `docker-compose` and `github-actions` files for outdated dependencies. For more information such as PR schedule or limitation, please check [renovate.yml](../.github/renovate.yml)

## How to handle Renovate PRs

When you see a PR generated by Renovate, here is what you can do as a reviewer:

1. Read the CHANGLOG.md or release note of this dependency to have a basic understanding of this update.
2. Make sure all GitHub actions checks have pass and test the automated Vercel deployment to see if anything breaks.

If the update fails the test or break the project (e.g. cause unexpected changes), here is what you can do:

1. Leave a comment in the PR and describe what you saw. (e.g. which test fails)
2. Pull the PR to your local, update the code to fix the problem, and push new commit to the same branch.
3. If the issue is hard to fix, please also leave a comment to discuss your thought with other reviewers.
