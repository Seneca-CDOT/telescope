{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>One of the key features of Seneca's open source involvement has been the\nemphasis on sharing what we're working on, teaching, and learning through blogging.\nWe believe that one of the most rewarding parts of learning to work in the\nopen source community is discovering that one can become part of the fabric\nof the web, find a voice, and build a following.</p>\n<p>We also believe that reading each other's blog posts is important. In the blog\nposts of our colleagues, we find that we are not alone in our struggles to make\nthings work, our interests in various topics, and that imposter syndrome isn't\nsomething unique to \"me.\"</p>\n<p>To better enable the discovery of blogs within our community, we set up an open\nsource blog <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)\">Planet</a>: an aggregated\nfeed of blog posts from Seneca faculty and students working on open source in a\nsingle page. Our old blog Planet used to live at <a href=\"http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/~chris.tyler/planet/\">http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/~chris.tyler/planet/</a>, and was run faithfully by Chris Tyler for more than a decade. We've made a re-creation of what it looked like at <a href=\"http://telescope.cdot.systems/planet\">http://telescope.cdot.systems/planet</a> if you want to see it..</p>\n<h2>What is a Planet?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an Internet community and display them on a single page. Planet runs on a web server. It creates pages with entries from the original feeds in chronological order, most recent entries first. --<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the early 2000s, before the rise of social media apps like Twitter and Facebook,\nPlanet solved an important problem in the free and open source community. It used\nvarious \"feed\" technologies (RSS, Atom, CDF) to allow blog posts from different\nplatforms to be aggregated into a single page that was constantly updated with\nthe latest posts by people within a particular community.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.gnome.org/~jdub/bzr/planet/devel/trunk/\">Written in Python by Jeff Waugh and Scott James Remnant</a>,\nPlanet could be configured with a list of blog feeds and an HTML template. It would\nuse these to dynamically generate a site with posts in chronological order from\nthe specified feeds.</p>\n<h2>In Search of a New Planet</h2>\n<p>Our original Planet was shutdown in January 2020. The <a href=\"https://people.gnome.org/~jdub/bzr/planet/devel/trunk/\">software we use was last updated 13 years ago</a>.\nWhile the underlying code has drifted further into the past, our needs have moved\nforward. Maintaining the existing system, especially with the number of students\ninvolved in open source at Seneca, has become too difficult. Our current site\noften breaks, and needs manual interventions on a regular basis. Going forward,\nwe need a new planet to call home.</p>\n<p>We have decided it is time to consider moving to\na new system. Unfortunately, almost every system that came to replace Planet has\nitself become unmaintained.</p>\n<p>Rather than try to find an existing solution, we have instead decided to try and\ncreate one. Because we need this software, we also feel that we should\ncreate and maintain it. And, since our need for a Planet comes out of our\ncollective work on open source, we think that creating it <em>together as open source</em>\nwould be the most desireable path forward.</p>\n<h2>Trying to Define Our Planet</h2>\n<p>We have learned a number of things over the past decade running our own planet.\nWe've also watched as social media and modern technologies have reshaped our\nexpectations for what a system like this can and should be.</p>\n<p>It's not 100% clear what we need to build, which is part of the fun. It is our\nhope that <em>you</em> will leave a mark on this project, and bring your own ideas,\nexperience, and code to the task of defining our planet.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/about","title":"About"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about"}}
